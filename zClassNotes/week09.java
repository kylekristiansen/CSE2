methods in your class

methods have the ability to create variables and process things
you are limited to get things into the method

nothing outside of the method is affected

method:
    public     static       type of output      name of method    (types of input)     {
        <code>
        return <output>;
    }
    
static method:
    system.out.println
    
non static method:
    scanner cause you declare it 
    
    
*********Passing by Value:***************
    passing by value is a characteristic of java that describes one aspect of method behavior
    
    you only get out of a method whatever it is that you TELL IT TO RETURN
    
    pass by value means that the values of input variables are copied when they are passed into a method
        INPUT VARIABLES CANNOT BE TREATED LIKE OUTPUTS
    
    pass by value copies input, pass by reference uses actual input and modifies it within the method
    
CRUCIAL POINT:
    if you modify the method arguments, the changes are visible inside the method, but they go away outside the method
    
    you have to capture the output of methods in main method variables
    

*************method overloading**************
    sometimes you have methods that do basically the same thing on different kinds of input, you dont want to have to speify a different method just because you have different input types
